# v2.0.1 - Echoes

**2020-02-26**
Although it might look, as if not much has changed, Trackbook has been re-written completely from scratch. Apart from resulting in better readable code for me, there are also a few new features in here:
- a Quick Settings tile allows starting a recording with one tap from anywhere
- the list of previous track allows you to mark your favorite recordings
- a new Settings screen offers some basic choices, like miles or kilometers, or light mode or dark mode theme

Plus: An important bug fix in the auto-importer for older recordings
